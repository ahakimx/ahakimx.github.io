Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts:

* Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
* You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
* Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
* Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
* Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality.
* New volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container.

In addition, volumes are often a better choice than persisting data in a container’s writable layer, because a volume does not increase the size of the containers using it, and the volume’s contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container. source: [https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/ "https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/")

Create docker volume:

    sudo docker volume create test-volume

see volumes

    sudo docker volume ls

see volume detail

    sudo docker volume inspect test-volume

run container with volume

    sudo docker run -d — name=nginxtest -v test-volume:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:latest

see IP address container

    sudo docker inspect nginxtest | grep -i ipaddress

Test browsing app

curl http:172.17.0.3

Create file index.html and move to source volume directory

    sudo echo "This is from test-volume source directory." > index.html
    sudo mv index.html /var/lib/docker/volumes/test-volume/_data

Then test again

Run container with read only volume

    sudo docker run -d — name=nginxtest-rovol -v test-volume:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro nginx:latest

view nginx container detail
