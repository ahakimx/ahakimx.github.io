Differences between user-defined bridges and the default bridge

> **_User-defined bridges provide better isolation and interoperability between containerized applications_**_._

Containers connected to the same user-defined bridge network automatically expose **all ports** to each other, and **no ports** to the outside world. This allows containerized applications to communicate with each other easily, without accidentally opening access to the outside world.

> **_User-defined bridges provide automatic DNS resolution between containers_**_._

Containers on the default bridge network can only access each other by IP addresses, unless you use the [`--link` option](https://docs.docker.com/network/links/), which is considered legacy. On a user-defined bridge network, containers can resolve each other by name or alias.

> **_Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly_**_._

During a containerâ€™s lifetime, you can connect or disconnect it from user-defined networks on the fly. To remove a container from the default bridge network, you need to stop the container and recreate it with different network options.

> **_Each user-defined network creates a configurable bridge_**_._

User-defined bridge networks are created and configured using `docker network create`. If different groups of applications have different network requirements, you can configure each user-defined bridge separately, as you create it.

> **_Linked containers on the default bridge network share environment variables_**_._

Containers connected to the same user-defined bridge network effectively expose all ports to each other. For a port to be accessible to containers or non-Docker hosts on different networks, that port must be _published_ using the `-p` or `--publish` flag. source: [https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/ "https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/")

**Create bridge network**

    sudo docker network create --driver bridge alpine-net

**View the network list**

    sudo docker network ls

**View the alpine-net network details**

    sudo docker network inspect alpine-net

> **_Create 3 container with:_**
>
> _1. alpine1 container connect to default bridge network_
>
> _2. alpine2 container connect to alpine-net network_
>
> _3. alpine3 container connect to network default bridge and alpine-net_

    sudo docker run -dit --name alpine1 alpine ash
    sudo docker run -dit --name alpine2 --network alpine-net alpine ash
    sudo docker run -dit --name alpine3 alpine ash
    sudo docker network connect alpine-net alpine3

**View network bridge details**

    sudo docker network inspect bridge

**view network alpine-net details**

    sudo docker network inspect apline-net

**Enter the alpine3 container and ping alpine1 ip, alpine1 and alpine2 name**

    sudo docker attach alpine3

ping IP alpine1

    ping -c 3 172.17.0.2

ping name alpine1

    ping -c 3 alpine1

ping alpine2 name

    ping -c 3 alpine2

**Enter the alpine2 and ping to alpine1 IP and ping to the internet**

    # ping -c 3 172.17.0.2

failed, because different bridge network and subnet

    # ping -c 3 8.8.8.8

ping internet will be succees.
